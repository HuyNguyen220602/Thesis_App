Overview
Bruxism (BRUK-siz-um) is a condition in which you grind, gnash or clench your teeth. If you have bruxism, you may unconsciously clench your teeth when you're awake (awake bruxism) or clench or grind them during sleep (sleep bruxism).
Sleep bruxism is considered a sleep-related movement disorder. People who clench or grind their teeth (brux) during sleep are more likely to have other sleep disorders, such as snoring and pauses in breathing (sleep apnea).

Symptoms
Signs and symptoms of bruxism may include:
•	Teeth grinding or clenching, which may be loud enough to wake up your sleeping partner.
•	Teeth that are flattened, fractured, chipped or loose.
•	Worn tooth enamel, exposing deeper layers of your tooth.
•	Increased tooth pain or sensitivity.
•	Tired or tight jaw muscles, or a locked jaw that won't open or close completely.
•	Jaw, neck or face pain or soreness
