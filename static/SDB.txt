Overview
Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) refers to a wide spectrum of sleep-related conditions including increased resistance to airflow through the upper airway, heavy snoring, marked reduction in airflow (hypopnea), and complete cessation of breathing (apnea). Increased resistance to airflow without frank apnea has been referred to as upper airway resistance syndrome; apneas and hypopneas are classified as central, obstructive, or mixed; Patients with sleep disordered breathing can experience daytime symptoms, such as sleepiness or excessive somnolence, depressed mood, irritability, and cognitive dysfunction, that can adversely effect health-related quality of life. The sequelae of SDB result both from apnea-associated oxygen desaturation and from sleep disturbance. Ultimately, this condition can lead to any number of medical problems, including increased automobile accidents, hypertension, cognitive impairment, impotence, and early death.
A variety of treatment options are available for patients with sleep disordered breathing.
