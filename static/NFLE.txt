Overview
Frontal lobe seizures can affect people while they’re awake or asleep, but are more common at night. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) occurs when people only experience the seizures in their sleep.
A frontal lobe seizure results from a period of abnormal electrical activity in the front section of your brain, behind your forehead. The frontal lobes are the largest of the four lobes in the brain.
